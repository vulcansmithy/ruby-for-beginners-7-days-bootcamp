# Does My Number Look Big In This?



## Instruction

A [Narcissistic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this coding exercise, we will restrict ourselves to decimal.

For example, take 153 (3 digits):

```
    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
```

and 1634 (4 digits):

```
    1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634
```

The Challenge:

Your code must return **true or false** depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10.



## Test

```
input: 5
result: true   # 5 is narcissistic
```



```
input: 153
result: true   # is narcissistic
```

```
input: 1633
result: false   # is NOT narcissistic
```
