# Complementary DNA



## Instruction

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols ``A`` and ``T`` are complements of each other, as ``C`` and ``G``.  Write a ruby program  that accept onse side of the DNA; you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all.

For example, 

```bash
DNA Strand: ATTGC<enter>
Complimentary Result: TAACG

DNA Strand: GTAT<enter>
Complimentary Result: CATA
```



# Testing

```
DNA Strand: AAAA<enter>
