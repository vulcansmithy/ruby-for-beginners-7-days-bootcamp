# Area of a Square



## Instruction

Write a ruby program that computes the Area of a Square. The formula for for computing the area of a sqare are as follows

```
area of a square = pi x radius^2  
```

Where, the ``pi``should be a constant type of variable. The value of ``pi`` should be ``3.141592653589793``.The ``radius`` should be entered by the user from the keyboard.

The output of the program should look something like this:

```
The radius of the circle is?: 200[enter]
The computed Area of the Square is 125663.70614359173
```



## Test

```
The radius of the circle is?: 250[enter]
The computed Area of the Square is 196349.54084936206
```

```
The radius of the circle is?: 500[enter]
The computed Area of the Square is 785398.1633974483 
```

```
The radius of the circle is?: 1234[enter]
The computed Area of the Square is 4783879.062809779  
```
