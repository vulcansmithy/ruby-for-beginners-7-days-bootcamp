# Highest and Lowest



# Instruction

In this coding exercise, write a ruby program that accept from the keyboard a given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Example,

```bash
input: 1 2 3 4 5[enter]
result: 5 1
```

```
input: 1 2 -3 4 5[enter]
result: 5 -3
```

```
input:  9 3 4 -5[enter]
result: 9 -5

```



**Note**

- All numbers are valid `Int32`, no *need* to validate them.
- There will always be at least one number in the input string.
- Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.



## Test

```
input: 4 5 29 54 4 0 -214 542 -64 1 -3 6 -6
result: 542 -214
```
